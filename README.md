# JunkFilesDeleter
Sometimes I download courses that contain many annoying .srt or .vtt files that I want to delete. So I got the idea to create a script that parses the main folder and all subfolder, enumerate all extensions of contained files, so I will be able to delete all srt files at once. Then I modified the script a little bit so it will show you all the extensions found and you can delete files other that .srt

# Usage:
Just run the script in the main folder you want to parse and it will prompt you to choose the desired extension.
